              <p>About Xing</p>
              <p>
                Hello, Welcome to my portfolio web page. My name is Xing, as you can see on the page. I am a 26-year-old male. I am originally from central China. I grew up in mountains. I like to be in a tranquil environment. I don't like the noises in the cities. It's going to make me crazy. When I don't have anything to do I spend lots of time on playing video games. That is the hobbie that I would never drop. Sleeping and eating weird food are my other hobbies. I like to eat chicken feet, pig feet something not too weird but still weird to most of you guys. Few months ago I decided to go to Epicodus for learning a profeesional skill -- coding. I guess I just like the feeling that sitting in front of my pc and working all day long. You will see few links of the practice files that I and my partners have done. Those are the basic things that what we do every day in the first week in Epicodus.

                <p>Background</p>
                <p>
                  I started to play piano when I was 4-year-old. Going to a musical college was my biggest dream. I grew up in a very strict family. My Dad wanted me to go to a military school because he was in military when he was young. Besides playing piano I didn't want to do anything else. So after I graduated from high school I got lost. I was trying to figure out where is my future. I went to France to learn hotel management. I went to Moscow, Russia to learn mechanic engineering. I studied bussiness in the States. I still couldn't find out what I want to do. I didn't know what I want to do or what I want to be in the future. Since then I spent lots of time on playing video games every day and working as a customer service at an asian market. Until I met the most imporant person in my live. He led me into the coding field. I found out that I even can stop playing video game.
